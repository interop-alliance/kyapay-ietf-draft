                         draft-dz-kyapayprofile

Abstract

   This document defines a profile for agent identity and payment tokens
   in JSON web token (JWT) format.  Authorization servers and resource
   servers from different vendors can leverage this profile to consume
   identity and payment tokens in an interoperable manner.

1.  Introduction

   As agents evolve from pre-orchestrated workflow automations to truly
   autonomous or semi-autonomous assistants, they need the ability to
   identify themselves and more importantly identify their human
   principals.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  KYAPay Token Schemas

3.1.  KYA Token

   The following informative example displays a decoded KYA type token.

{
  "kid": "<JWK Key ID>",
  "alg": "ES256",
  "typ": "kya+JWT"
}.{
  "iss": "<URL of the token issuer>",
  "iat": 1742245254,  // 'issued at' timestamp
  "exp": 1773867654,  // 'expiration' timestamp
  "jti": "b9821893-7699-4d24-af06-803a6a16476b", // Unique token ID
  "sub": "<Buyer Agent Account ID>",
  "aud": "<Seller Agent Account ID>",

  // Claims common to both 'pay' and 'kya' types
  "env": "<Issuer environment (sandbox, production, etc)>",
  "ver": "1", // Version of the token
  "ssi": "<Seller Service ID>", // Seller service that this token was created for
  "btg": "<Buyer Tag (Buyer's internal reference ID)>",

  // Skyfire-defined claims for 'kya' (Know Your Agent) type tokens
  "bid": {  // Buyer Identity claims
    "email": "buyer@buyer.com”,
    ...
  },
  "apd": { // Agent Platform Identity claims
  },
  "aid": { // Agent Identity claims
  }
}
