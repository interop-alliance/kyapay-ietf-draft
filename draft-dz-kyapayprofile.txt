                     draft-dz-kyapayprofile-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a profile for agent identity and payment tokens
   in JSON web token (JWT) format.  Authorization servers and resource
   servers from different vendors can leverage this profile to consume
   identity and payment tokens in an interoperable manner.

1.  Introduction

   As agents evolve from pre-orchestrated workflow automations to truly
   autonomous or semi-autonomous assistants, they need the ability to
   identify themselves and more importantly identify their human
   principals.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terms iss, iat, exp, jti, aud, typ are defined in [RFC7519].

   The alg value ES256 is a digital signature algorithm described in
   Section 3.4 of [RFC7518].

2.1.  Roles

   Agent:  todo ...

   Agent Platform:  todo ...

   Principal:  A legal entity (human or organization) on whose behalf /
      in whose authority an agent or service is operating.

   Buyer Principal:  A legal entity (human or organization) behind the
      purchase / consumption of a product or service.  Typically
      interacts with the seller via an agent, agentic interface, or a
      programmatic interface (API).  The Buyer Principal gives the agent
      or interface permission to act on their behalf.

   Seller Service:  todo ...

   Settlement Network:  todo ...

3.  KYAPay Token Schemas

3.1.  Common Token Claims

   The following are claims in common, used within the KYA (Know Your
   Agent), PAY (Payment), and KYA+PAY (combined Know Your Agent and
   Payment) Tokens:

   iss:  REQUIRED - The issuer as defined in ...

   sub:  ? - Subject Identifier as defined in ...

   aud:  REQUIRED - ...

   iat:  REQUIRED - as defined in Section 4.1.6 of [RFC7519].

   jti:  REQUIRED - Unique ID of this JWT as defined in Section 4.1.7 of
      [RFC7519].

   exp:  REQUIRED - as defined in Section 4.1.4 of [RFC7519].

   env:  OPTIONAL - Issuer environment (such as "sandbox" or
      "production").

   ver:  ? - Version of the token schema.

   ssi:  ? - Seller Service ID that this token was created for.

   btg:  ? - Buyer tag, an opaque reference ID internal to the buyer.

3.2.  KYA Token

   The following identity related claims are used within KYA and KYA+PAY
   tokens:

   bid:  ? - Buyer identity claims

   apd:  OPTIONAL - Agent Platform identity claims.

   aid:  OPTIONAL - Agent identity claims.

   The following informative example displays a decoded KYA type token.

   {
     "kid": "<JWK Key ID>",
     "alg": "ES256",
     "typ": "kya+JWT"
   }.{
     "iss": "<URL of the token issuer>",
     "iat": 1742245254,

3.3.  PAY Token

   The following payment related claims are used within PAY and KYA+PAY
   type tokens:

      PAY_PER_USE).

   amount:  ? - Token amount in currency units.

   cur:  ? - Currency unit, as defined in ...

   value:  ? - Token amount in settlement network

   mnr:  OPTIONAL - Maximum number of requests when sps is PAY_PER_USE

   stp:  OPTIONAL - Settlement type (one of COIN, CARD, or BANK).

   sti:  OPTIONAL - Meta information for payment settlement, depending
      on settlement type.
